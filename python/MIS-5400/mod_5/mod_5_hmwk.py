# Question 1 #

'''
Define a function that meets the following reqs:
1. Accepts a string > 3 characters.
2. If the string is less than 4 characters raise an Exception with an appropriate message.
3. Capitalizes ONLY the first letter in the sentence.
4. Replaces all letters 'z' or 's' with '5'.
5. Returns the new string (with capitalization and replaced letters)

'''
Define a function that meets the following reqs:
1. Accepts a string > 3 characters.
2. If the string is less than 4 characters raise an Exception with an appropriate message.
3. If the string contains any non-alpha characters (EXCLUDING SPACES), raise an appropriate message
4. Make all of the characters in the string lowercase
5. Reverse the string
6. Return the new string.

# Question 3 #

'''
Define a function that meets the following reqs:
1. Accepts 3 string parameters, a full sentence, a string to be replaced, and the string to replace it with
2. This function should take a full string, and replace all instances of the "string to be replaced" with the "string to replace"...
3. for example: func("Hello World", "Hello", "Good Bye") would return "Good Bye World"
