    // Business, Engineering, UX people
        // Business refers to people such as upper management, product managers, marketing people, and salespeople—either in your own company or in your client’s company. They can help you ensure that your research is on track with current business goals. The support of upper management is invaluable to ensure that you have the time and resources needed for your research and that the company will invest in any design changes that might follow from your research.
        // Engineering stakeholders are, for instance, developers, quality assurance people, and technical/customer support. Engineering stakeholders can give you information about technological limitations and possibilities. Moreover, developers are the ones who must implement any design changes that might come from your research project.
        // UX stakeholders are the other designers and researchers working on the project, as well as the technical writers who write the user guidelines. They are the ones who also need the results of your research and whom you must agree with on the design direction of the project. UX stakeholders will be able to provide you with more knowledge about your project and with different angles on the user experience.
