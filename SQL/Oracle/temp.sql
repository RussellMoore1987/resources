-- Tips: Write two separate queries to start. One query should pull the total sales and buyer zips by day. Keep in mind that the order_date field includes times. Second query should pull a list of each day in the month of November. Use levels to do this. Here's a hint: If you start by selecting the date of Nov 1, 2012 from dual, add the first level value to it, and subtract 1, you'll get Nov 1. Keep doing that for each day in November. You'll need 30 levels to span all of November. Lastly, join your two queries together to get each day in November with the total sales for that day and the buyer zips.
